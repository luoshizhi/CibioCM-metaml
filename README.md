# MetAML - Metagenomic prediction Analysis based on Machine Learning  #

MetAML is a computational tool for **metagenomics-based prediction tasks** and for quantitative assessment of the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations.

The tool (i) is based on machine learning classifiers, (ii) includes automatic model and feature selection steps, (iii) comprises cross-validation and cross-study analysis, and (iv) uses as features quantitative microbiome profiles including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific markers.

It provides also species-level taxonomic profiles, marker presence data, and metadata for **3000+ public available metagenomes**.
